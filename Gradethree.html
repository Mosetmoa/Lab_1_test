        <h1>Who is Moa?</h1>
        <p>My name is Moa and I am an illustrator. I am currently selling prints of playul characters at my own <a href="https://www.marsmoa.se/">website</a>. That website is orginally created by MM Design through wordpress. However, since I have my own webpage I want to undertstand the bascis of both HTML, CSS and Javascript to be able to improve the webpage in the future.</p>

    <h3>School and work</h3>
    <p><em>As I have mentioned before, my name is Moa, I am 30 years old and I illustrate playful images that I am trying to sell through my own webpage marsmoa.</em> <br><br> However, this is not my job, I only do this as a hobby. But hopefully this will cover at least 50% of my income in the future, so I can do it half time. Today I am just a student, and I have been for a while now.
    <br><br> I have studied art and design for one semester at London Metropolitan University in 2017, graphic design for one semester at Malm√∂ University in 2018, and now I have been studying remote, free-standning courses through different universities around Sweden since 2021. Which was a better fit for me. I have also worked as a product photographer and editing images for a local photo studio. I worked there on and off between 2013-2022.
    </p>


    <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
    <p> My main hobby is not illustrating, even though it is a big part of my life. There is actually one hobby that has taken over most of my free time, which is gardening. Me and my boyfriend (who studies to become a real gardener), bought an allotment near our apartment earlier this year.
    </p>
        <div class="biography right"><img src="potato.jpg" alt="An image"object-fit: contain;></div>
       <p> Since then we have renovated the small cottage on out plot, and created a big vegetable garden. And we are currently working on builing a new porch. I just love gardening, builing things and renovating. Just being creative through different outlets I guess.
 </p>
 <h3>Top 5 hobbies</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>Gardening</li>
     <li>Renovating</li>
     <li>Illustrating</li>
     <li>Foraging</li>
     <li>Writing</li>
 </ul>

    <h3>Future goals</h3>
    <p>I hope to find a job after my courses finish. Then I hope I get to illustrate more in my life, and eventually maybe make a living out of it. Then I hope to buy a small farm with a giant garden and have a studio for all things creative.</p>
